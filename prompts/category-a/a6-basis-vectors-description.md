**Topic**: Basis Vectors and Change of Basis

**Context**: This is part of an interactive Three.js visualization portfolio. The learner will see the same point described in different coordinate systems and understand how basis vectors define a coordinate system.

**Prerequisites the learner should already understand**:
- Vectors and vector operations (A1)
- Matrix multiplication as transformation (A2)
- Basic coordinate systems

**Learning Objectives** — After reading this explanation, the learner should:
1. Understand that basis vectors define a coordinate system
2. Know that any vector can be written as a linear combination of basis vectors
3. Understand how the same point has different coordinates in different bases
4. Know how to convert between coordinate systems using matrices
5. Connect basis to neural network embeddings and feature spaces

**Required Sections**:
1. **What are Basis Vectors?** — The "measuring sticks" of a coordinate system
2. **Standard Basis** — The i, j, k vectors we take for granted
3. **Linear Combinations** — Every vector = sum of scaled basis vectors
4. **Non-Standard Bases** — Using different measuring sticks
5. **Same Point, Different Coordinates** — The key insight
   - A position doesn't change
   - Its numeric description depends on the basis
6. **Change of Basis Matrix** — Converting coordinates between systems
7. **Why This Matters for ML/AI**:
   - **Embeddings**: Words/images represented in learned basis
   - **Feature Spaces**: Different layers = different coordinate systems
   - **PCA**: Finding a better basis for your data
   - **Attention**: Query/Key/Value are different projections (bases)
   - **Transfer Learning**: Aligning embedding spaces
8. **Visual Intuition** — Grid lines changing when basis changes

**Tone**: Emphasize the intuition that coordinates are just descriptions relative to a chosen reference. Use real-world analogies (different maps of the same territory).

**Length**: Approximately 1400-1800 words with clear examples.
