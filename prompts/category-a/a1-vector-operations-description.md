You are creating educational content for a developer learning AI/ML who has a weak mathematics background.

**Topic**: Vector Operations (Addition, Subtraction, Scaling, Dot Products)

**Context**: This is part of an interactive Three.js visualization portfolio teaching neural network mathematics. The learner will see an interactive 2D/3D visualization alongside this explanation.

**Prerequisites the learner should already understand**:
- Basic coordinate systems (x, y, z axes)
- What a number line is
- Basic arithmetic operations

**Learning Objectives** — After reading this explanation, the learner should:
1. Understand what a vector represents (magnitude + direction)
2. Know how to perform vector addition and subtraction geometrically
3. Understand scalar multiplication and its effect on vectors
4. Grasp the dot product as a measure of similarity/alignment
5. Connect these concepts to their use in neural networks (e.g., weighted sums)

**Required Sections**:
1. **Intuitive Introduction** — What is a vector? Use real-world analogies (movement, force, direction)
2. **Vector Addition & Subtraction** — Geometric interpretation (tip-to-tail method), with worked examples
3. **Scalar Multiplication** — Stretching/shrinking vectors, negative scalars flip direction
4. **The Dot Product** — Three interpretations:
   - Algebraic: multiply corresponding components and sum
   - Geometric: projection of one vector onto another
   - Similarity: measuring how "aligned" two vectors are (cos θ)
5. **Why This Matters for ML/AI**:
   - Neurons compute weighted sums (dot products of inputs and weights)
   - Embeddings use dot products to measure similarity
   - Attention mechanisms rely on dot product similarity
6. **Mathematical Notation** — Introduce standard notation (bold letters, arrow notation, component form)
7. **Common Pitfalls** — Mistakes developers often make

**Tone**: Conversational but precise. Use code analogies where helpful (vectors as arrays, dot product as reduce operation). Avoid jargon without explanation.

**Length**: Comprehensive — approximately 1500-2000 words with clear section headings.
